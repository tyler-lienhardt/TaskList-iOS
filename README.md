## Lessons Learned
The similarities between Android and iOS development are not immediately apparent due to the differences in approach between Android Studio and Xcode. Once I tried both, I had a better understanding of how View Controllers, UI elements, and data models were all working together. The initial newness of Swift, Xcode and iOS were overwhelming until I saw the same concepts play out with the Android framework, Activities, and .xml files.

I learned a good deal about swift, and thanks to Apple's tutorial, a little bit about TDD.
